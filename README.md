# Pit
This is an exercise for Shutter Flight, as instructed in (https://github.com/HendrixString/sfly-quest).

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thanks.

# Some info
 - I've tried to meet the required specs, hope there was no misunderstandings.

 - In order to initiate the app I had to hard code some of the parmeters as defaults, but all of them are approachable if needed.

 - If you have any questions, you can reach me at (liordwek@gmail.com)
